Brady Code Challenge

To use, run App.java. This will run endlessly until terminated.
While running, the program will watch the outer directory 'Input' for changes.
If a new file or modification to an existing file is detected then that file will be taken and processed.
The outer folder 'static' must contain a file with the name and schema of 'ReferenceData.xml' as the reference values are needed for processing.
The outer folder 'output' is the target directory for the output xml file.
The file entered into the 'input' folder may be titled anything but must follow the schema of GenerationReport.xml.
